.SH NAME
hsh - simple shell, a simple shell command language interpreter

.SH PROLOG
This manual page of a Holberton Simple Shell (hsh) may differ from the standard Shell interfase (sh) of Linux

.SH SYSNOPSIS
The shell is executed by typing ./hsh

.SH DESCRIPTION
The utility of shs is that it is a command language interpreter that executes commands read from a command line string, standard input, or a specified file.

.SH OPTIONS
If there are no operands shs shall read commands from the standard input. If there are no operands and the shell's standard input and standard error are attached to a terminal, the shell is considered to be interactive.

.SH OPERANDS
Operands don't shall be supported by shs

.SH STDIN
The standard input shall be used if one of the following is true:
The script executes one or more commands that require input from standard input (such as a read command that does not redirect its input).

.SH INPUT FILES
Input files not supported

.SS ENVIROMENT VARIABLES
*ENV  This variable, when and only when an interactive shell is invoked  and the resulting value shall be used as a pathname of a file containing shell commands to execute in the current environment. The file need not be executable. If the expanded value of ENV is not an absolute pathname, the results are unspecified. ENV shall be ignored if the real and effective user IDs or real and effective group IDs of the process are different.
.br
*HOME
Determine the pathname of the user's home directory.
.br
*LANG
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
.br
*PATH
Establish a string formatted
.br
.IP *PWD
This variable shall represent an absolute pathname of the current working directory. Assignments to this variable may be ignored.

.SH ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
 The sh utility shall take the standard action for all signals. If the shell is interactive, SIGINT signals received during command line editing shall be handled as described in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION, and SIGINT signals received at other times shall be caught but no action performed.

.SH STDOUT
See \fBSTDERR

.SH STDERR
Except as otherwise stated (by the descriptions of any invoked utilities or in interactive mode), standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

.SH OUTPUT FILES
None

.B *Interactive mode:
.br ./hsh

.B *Non interactive mode:
.br echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh

$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
$ cat test_ls_2
/bin/ls
/bin/ls
$
$ cat test_ls_2 | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
